description of the assignment: create a responsive news-site with flexbox and css grid.

- How you approached the task, what tools and techniques you used, and how you planned it

I started with designing the webpage on paper first and tried to write down what different html-elements and css classes I was going to use. This of course changed a bit when i started writing everyting down in code. 

I then tried to implement that in my html code. I stated with the header, nav bar etc and then worked my way down. I added the specific links and images later on because i wanted to prioritise getting the structure of the htlm down first. 

- If you had more time, what would be next?
